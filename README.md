# WhataPOS
WhataPOS is a simple point of sale system created for a subset of the Whataburger menu by a group of students for a class project.

Unfortunately it relies on a large set of order histories stored in a deprecated TAMU database and is unable to function properly, however we still would like to showcase the hard work we put into building this project.

Please read about the features and screenshots below and check out the code base!

Features include:
  - Employee & customer login
  - Full customer ordering experience
  - Menu item customization
  - Item recommendations by category
  - Inventory management
  - Current ordering trends
  - Order search by date
